### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I am Snel from SAYNA. It's a digital school to learn all digital jobs with a good family sipirit and game way.
I'm intersted in code because I am following this course right now. 
I'm currently learning all things about development and specifically how to learn it.
I'm looking to collaborate on many projects to see all the methodly development in the world, good luck for me.
